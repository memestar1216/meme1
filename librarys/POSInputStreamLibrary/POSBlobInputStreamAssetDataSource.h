                sync mode is that you can not use it while working with a stream

    @brief The suspicious size of assets to detect adjusted photos in iOS 8 gallery.
           The default value is 1M.
 
    @discussion System Camera app has a strange behaviour on iOS 8. If you turn ON
                built-in filters and make a photo with them, then metadata of that
                photo will not have adjustent XML. At the same time the size of the
                asset will be something about 150-300K instead of usual 1.5-3M. This
                property is used for detecting that kind of adjusted images on iOS 8.
                If asset is smaller than adjustedImageMaximumSize value then iOS 8
                Photos framework will be used for reading asset's data. The drawback
                is the app will consume much more RAM, because instead of streaming
                asset directly from ALAssetsLibrary it will allocate RAM for the whole
                UIImage at once.
 
    @remarks See comments in POSAdjustedAssetReaderIOS8.h for more info.
